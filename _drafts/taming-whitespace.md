## Changes Via Customize

* Turn on global whitespace mode
* Turn off (probably):
  * Long lines (or make it less distracting)
  * Spaces - since this is what I expect whitespace to be
  * Endlines (probably) - since the only place I need to see this would be EOF - otherwise, not needed
* Whitespace action:
  * probably just report-on-bogus - everything else is too aggressive with version control
