To be written - document how I'm using Emacs Server on Mac OS. Also include installation instructions.

Reference: https://korewanetadesu.com/emacs-on-os-x.html

Mention the problem with New Frame - that would be the ideal fix... research?

Mention kill-emacs

Also mention restarting with Launchctl (start)

Think of a new title... this one doesn't work.
